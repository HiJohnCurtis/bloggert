My first time at Render.. wow. I had initially heard about Render from Mrs.Auriel Dickey whom I had met while working at Kroger around October 2024! After we had talked I had went home and looked it up to learn more about the conference and it had piqued my interest. 

I had attended the workshops and met some cool people that I ended up connecting with on linkedin during the workshop involving MCPs and Goose, though I couldnt exactly participate due to needing to download content off the AmericasMart wifi which was not the best by any means.

Outside of that though the rest of my time was amazing!! There was tons of other events happening due to it also being Atlanta Tech Week providing lots to do and lots of opportunities to connect with other people outside of the main conference center, a lot of the networking events felt more like parties which was great because I feel like it made it easier to approach people on a personal level as compared to making it feel like you are trying to social climb or something along those lines. I really enjoyed walking around the expo hall and talking to the recruiters and engineers that had booths in the hall as they provided me with very vaulable advice and after the 3 days I spent attending Render I can definitely say that I feel insipired to keep going.

Truthfully, the job search has been hard on me mentally. It's been more than a year since I graduated from Full Sail and started looking for my first entry level position and my drive has continued to decline as more time has passed, however, Render has changed that for me. Render provided me a space that was filled with so much good energy and good people that it has motivated me to keep trying, to keep chasing my dreams and keep improving on my ideas.

Very special shoutout to Mrs. Dickey for introducing me to Render as well as a big thanks to Olumide and Irving and all the amazing folks that I was able to connect with for making my first Render such a special experience.
