I have quite a wide array of hobbies and interests such as programming, perfumery, music both enjoying as a listener as well as learning to play. I also enjoy cooking though I definitely have a lot to work on in that sector but thats just a part of learning and trying to do something new! I had worked on this blog as a way to improve my programming skills as well as providing myself a place where I could discuss my interests!
