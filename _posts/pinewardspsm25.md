The reviews are listed in order from left to right

## Pineward Spring 2025 Samples

Acadian - Juniper berry and Eucalyptus are the star of the show in the opening providing a slightly spicy and herbal experience thats mostly all I can really get out of it but its airy but also slightly aquatic and is very nice quite “green” On the drydown it sweetens a little but keeps most of its original qualities

After The Flood - Very dirty/earthy, kind of transports me to the middle of a forest after it has rained some days ago being surrounded by mud also smells a bit medicinal

Anabasis - Very natural mint with a slight bit of earthiness and a bit of pine in the background very interesting really enjoy this one drydown has a lot of mint appear

Bindebole - Lost in the forest, foliage everywhere, crashing through bushes and getting whiffs of the natural scent of the forest, fresh and woody has a very slight christmas tree smell almost 

Coastal Veil - Watery, spicy, green reminds me of the incense that gets burned in catholic churches when you first enter love the eucalyptus in this because it provides that spicy, airy, medicinal smell

Ivymoss - SMELLS LIKE A SWEET MINT TEA WITH HONEY AND A LEMON SQUEEZED IN but also smells a little bit like bubble gum? like dubble bubble super nice IN LOVE my favorite tea scent BY FAR YUMYYY in the drydown reminds me less of tea and leans more towards wahtever the bubble gum aspect in it is 

Juniperus - WOAH? fresh spicy and sweet, sweetness reminds me how grenadine tastes wait kinda getting something gamey thats cutting through such a relaxing scent 2nd favorite for sure on the drydown its what ever was “gamey” is less intense appears to be some mint reminds me less of grenadine pivot to a lime jarrito/licorice candy

Meadowmoss - puts you in a field with tall grass surrounding you and natural vegetables growing out of the ground in the mountains very airy and slightly has the fresh cut grass smell but theres something thats also adding some spiciness that i cant put my finger on

Oxylus - GREEN, earthy, piny not much to say but a good fragrance nonetheless Top 3
Clemenpine - orange creamsicle ice cream bar, insane scent clementine is very forward with the blood orange providing something very citric and sweet as well as something fruity very slight bit of dirty and spiciness coming from the tobacco leaf i believe as well, wow

## Pineward Summer 2025 Samples

Delfino - Fresh and has a realistic clementine smell, like you’re peeling it in your hands and getting whiffs of it clean and citric in the drydown the clementine disappears and you’re left with this clean smell

Lime Cola - No real effervescence coming from the fragrance which is slightly disappointing, does smell like a Lime Cola however it smells like the pure syrup that would come out of a soda machine not sure how to feel does do a really good job of reminding me of coca cola 

Noki - Mint and Lychee at the forefront however it does remind me of those little layered gums that would have the gel in the middle not a very notable mango note however I could kind of see it being like a mango gum or something along those lines, very sweet and quite fruity, drydown gets rid of a lot of that and becomes more woody/rooty almost like a weird root beer?

The Peradam - Kind of smells like flour? kind of airy but also has a strange smoothness? powdery and woody not my favorite but definitely a unique scent might smell nice on a woman kind of growing on me has moved to something kind of buttery

(BONUS) Tome - not getting much from the opening, will wait till drydown, slightly smoky i think it fits its namesake well kind of reminds me of like a really old book someone had described it as an old leather bound book and i think i shall echo that statement
